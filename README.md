* [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)

* Visual Studio Code, with NML plug-in

## Purpose of KeepinItMail
To be honest, sometimes Mail can be a bit of a chore since you care less about it than Passengers and Freight.

**So why not just ignore it?** <br />
Some town growth scripts require Mail to be transported to satisfy goals, otherwise the town won't grow. So, like it or not, Mail needs dealt with.

**So why would you use these trucks?**<br />
High level capacities are not meant to be 'realistic' or 'balanced'. They are simply meant to make Mail much easier by;
* Reducing the number of vehicles dedicated to Mail
* Reducing the time needed to micro-manage Mail
